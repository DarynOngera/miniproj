Pong Game with Power-Ups and Downgrades
This is a Pygame implementation of a classic Pong-style game with added power-up and downgrade features. The game allows players to control a paddle, hit the ball, and collect items to alter the paddle size, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy.

Features
Classic Pong Mechanics: Control the paddle to bounce the ball and score points.
Power-Ups and Downgrades: Collect power-ups to increase paddle size and downgrades to decrease paddle size.
Lives and Score Tracking: Score points with each successful hit, and keep an eye on lives to stay in the game.
Background Image: Customizable background image to enhance game visuals.
Game Over Display: When lives reach zero, the game ends with a "Game Over" message.
Gameplay
Use the Left Arrow (←) and Right Arrow (→) keys to move the paddle.
Hit the ball with the paddle to keep it from falling.
Collect Green Power-Ups to increase the paddle size and Red Downgrades to decrease the paddle size.
If the ball falls below the paddle, you lose a life.
The game ends when you run out of lives.
